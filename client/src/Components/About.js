      <h2>About Fitness Guru</h2>
      <p>My own experience has taught me that the inability to create or follow a fitness plan is necessarily due to a ack of wanting to. 
        There have been so many times that I made up my mind to follow a specific plan,only to get sidetracked by.. well, life. I finally realized 
        that I would have a more positive outcome if I could have a detailed plan created, receive appropriate guidance, and have someone hold 
        me accounatble, it increases the likelihood that I wold stick with a plan long term. With this in mind, I set out to create a service that 
        encompassed all that and more and Fitness Guru was bone.
